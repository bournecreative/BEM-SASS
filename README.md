# Grid System

Experiementing with Sass and BEM to generate functonal css rules.

## Details

When looking at the SCSS files, there is very little SCSS in comparison to the generated CSS file. This demonstrates how we can begin to build out foundational rules sets that can help maintain goverence of branding style guides.

The main purpose of this exercise is to focus on leveraging SCSS functionaility to leverage maps, loops, variables and if directives to generate robust css rule sets.

- Functional CSS classes are in place for font sizes, font colors, background colors, margin, padding, height, and a responsive grid.
