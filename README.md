# BoilerPlate CSS Rules using BEM and SASS

Experiementing with Sass generating functonal css rules. When looking at the SCSS files, there is very little SCSS in comparison to the generated CSS file. This demonstrates how we can begin to build out standard CSS rule sets from style guides.

## Details

I will continue to build on this. Just usign SASS variables, loops and maps, a lot can be acomplished. And its pretty straightforward and maintainable once put into action.

So far..

- Stand font classes created based on fictional font rules
- Standard color classes created based on fictional color palette
